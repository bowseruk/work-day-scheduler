# Bootcamp Challenge 7 - Work Day Scheduler

## Description 

This project was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery to make a Work Day Scheduler. The project had the following requirements:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
* Persist events between refreshes of a page.

The page in this repo is the result.
